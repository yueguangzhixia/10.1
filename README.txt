Class Documentation

In this program, I created a little competition between two Pokemon Players where they walk in different speed which player a could start first with a faster pace and another 
with slower pace. Then eventually they would be walk toward an end where they would see how far they got to. So I created this class call Pokemon_go.
I basically start by adding commands like self.name,self.speed for my players and their name can be display with their speed as my data variables. Then I created my two get-set me-
thods which I set my location of the players at 0 with self.location = 0, then I get the location back with self.location. My other set are returning the name and the 
location as they progress.

Demo Program Documentation:
After I set up my class, I begin to type in more commands such as adding the first player's name in the main function which I called it KamenRiderOMO as my first argument setting as name. Then
I include 22 as my speed for the first one. Then I set my second player as Yueguangzhixia and set his speed to 33. The first player would go 3 times first then the second player 
go one time, then both player move at the same time.
The other user can change the name of the player and the speed of the player as they want.
